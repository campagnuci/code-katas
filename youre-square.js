// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
// And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building
// blocks!
// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with
// an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether
// you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your
// number of building blocks is a perfect square.
// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square
// of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
// Examples
// isSquare(-1) returns  false
// isSquare(0) returns   true
// isSquare(3) returns   false
// isSquare(4) returns   true
// isSquare(25) returns  true
// isSquare(26) returns  false

var isSquare = function(n){
  if(n < 0) return false;

  var squareRoot = Math.sqrt(n);
  var floor = Math.floor(squareRoot);
  if(squareRoot - floor == 0) return true;
  else return false;
}

console.log(`${isSquare(-1)} -1 Negative numbers cannot be square numbers`);
console.log(`${isSquare( 0)} 0 is a square number (0 * 0)`);
console.log(`${isSquare( 3)} 3 is not a square number`);
console.log(`${isSquare( 4)} 4 is a square number (2 * 2)`);
console.log(`${isSquare(25)} 25 is a square number (5 * 5)`);
console.log(`${isSquare(26)} 26 is not a square number`);
